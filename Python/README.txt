Prewritten projects are there for reference from what I have learned during my time at college.
Personal projects are ones that I have done. Some important ones to reference when it comes to viewing my work is GroupChat and OneWayMessage.
Both programs introduced me to websocket programming. Other ones are learning various data structures and algorithms.
