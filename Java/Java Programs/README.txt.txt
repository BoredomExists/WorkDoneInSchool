# Information about some programs

These are programs I have done in college. Every program except Spanglish Journey and Lottery GUI were assignments with some completion to them.
To view what work I have done, view files that have Christian Biermann listed at the top of the file.

LotteryGUI was an assignment I work on alone, and Spanglish Journey was a group assignment which was simulated to be similar to a real world project idea.
