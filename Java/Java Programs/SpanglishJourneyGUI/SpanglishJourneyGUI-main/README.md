SpanglishJourney
This application was designed for anyone that wants to learn a foreign language. We understand learning a new language is one of the toughest skills to learn and our goal is to make this process fun, enjoyable, and easy for most young adults. Our project will include modules of varying subjects that holds lessons that have different kinds of questions for the user to answer and learn. This project will also involve making friends and trying to be at the top of our leaderboard. Users can earn points to rise in the leaderboard by completing lessons.
